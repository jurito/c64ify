Source code for [c64.juri.to](https://c64.juri.to).

Simple React based PWA that renders an image or a cam stream source on a canvas and applies a custom fragment shader to make it look like it would on a glorious [Commodore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64).

WebGL stuff courtesy of [twgl.js](https://github.com/greggman/twgl.js/).
